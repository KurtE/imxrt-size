Overview and Warning: 
=====
This simple program was developed mostly during the Beta cycle for the PJRC Teensy 4 board.
The original ideas and code was originally developed by the forum member @Frank B 

Some of the original code base and source code is in the monster thread associated with the beta
https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/54711-Teensy-4-0-First-Beta-Test?p=197833&viewfull=1#post197833

Several other members of the forum later made suggestions on changes including updating it to work
with the Beta 2 boards which were functionally the same as the released boards. 

More detail about this including how to change your platform.txt file to run this are also up in the thread, in the first couple of postings.

If you have any questions or run into any issues with this program, you should probably post your questions
up on the PJRC forum, where I can always say: it is probably someone else's fault  :D ;)
